Left Atrial Enlargement (LAE) is a heart condition associated with
cardiovascular issues and is a predictor of mortality.  See:

It is NOT Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM, HOCM), which may cause 
sudden death with little or no warning among young athletes, though
it may be preceded by fainting, shortness of breath, heart
palpitations, etc.  HCM is caused by a genetic defect of up to 12
genes, which account for only 60% of cases.  It is hard to diagnose.
(Would be nice to get genetic study data, for data science project?)

* Note any such application should be marked DEMO, NOT FOR
  MEDICAL USE, UNRELIABLE, PLEASE CONSULT YOUR PHYSICIAN, etc.

* It's probably a good idea to have a user login page that must be 
  approved by an admin before allowing access, so there's no way
  the general public could use it.

LAE has a definitive diagnosis, with the following patient
information relevant.  

  personal: patient_id(str), (name), sex(f/m), datetime, outcome
    obesity (mild, moderate, severe)?  (weight, height -> obesity?)

  X-RAY (if present):         need to find a reasonable formula
    direct signs (direct visualization):
      double density sign (T, F, Unsure) - most important indicator
      oblique atrial diameter > 7 cm (bad) (should include double density)
      left atrial appendage is: (convex, bad) or (concave | flat, good)
        (convex < 180 deg, concave > 180 deg)
    indirect signs:
      splayed carina:
        interbronchial angle: 34-109 normal, > 109 bad
        subcarinal angle    : 34-90 normal,  > 90 bad
      posterior displacement of left main bronchus, lateral view: True bad, False good
      superior displacement of left main bronchus, frontal view: True bad, False good
      posterior displacement of esophagus or nasogastric tube: True bad, False good

  CT / MRI (if present):
    volume is more accurate than diameter
    left atrial AP diameter: women > 40 mm, men > 41 mm bad
      women: 27-38 mm normal, 39-42 mild, 43-46 moderate, >= 47 severe
      men:   30-40 mm normal, 41-46 mild, 47-52 moderate, >= 52 severe
    atrial volume measurements: women > 53 ml, men > 59 ml bad
      women: 22-52 ml normal, 53-62 mild, 63-72 moderate, >= 73 severe
      men:   18-58 ml normal, 59-68 mild, 69-78 moderate, >= 79 severe
        a4 = (4-chamber view area) mm^2
        a2 = (2-chamber view area) mm^2
        l1 = (shortest inferior-superior atrial length) mm
        volume = 8pi/3 * a4 * a2 / l1
